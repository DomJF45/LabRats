# Lab Rats

LabRats is a management system for research laboratories at institutions. No longer will Research Labs have to communicate through email each time a task needs to completed, or assigned. With LabRats you can simply create/join a lab that contains a list of Projects, with tasks inside each project. This way, Research teams can simply log on and view their required tasks.

# How to Use it

### Regsitering
When registering (accessible by clicking 'Get Started Now !!' on the landing page), you will need to provide your Name, Email, Password, Password Confirmation, and your Role. After registering, you will be directed to the dashboard. 

### Logging In
Upon logging in, you will be directed to a dashboard. Logically, the dashboard should be empty as you do not have any labs registered or joined.
Because LabRats is Role-based, you need to have selected Principle Investigator (PI) upon registering in order to Create a lab. If you seleced Graduate Research Assistant or Undergraduate Research Assistant, you will only have the ability to Join a lab. 

### Logging Out
Upon registering an account, or logging in, you will be redirected to a dashboard.
Logically, the dashboard should be empty as you do not have any labs registered or joined.
If you click the down arrow next to your name on the top left of the navigation panel, you will see a button with the option to log out. Pressing it will remove your user info from your browsers local storage. If you do not log out, LabRats will remember you user info, saving you time by allowing you to skip logging in each time you visit the website.

### Creating a Lab
If you have PI priviledges, you can create a lab by clicking the down arrow next to your username. Then, click User Info. If you select the Lab tab to the left of settings and under the User tab, you will have the ability to create a lab. You can specify the Lab Name, Institution, and Field of Study, as well as set a password for others to join.

You will then see a list of your labs once you have created one, alongside an ID for each lab. You can then provide this ID to any one of your Research Assistants alongside the password, and your Research Assistants will be able to access the Lab with its Projects and Tasks.

### Joining a Lab
If you are a Research Assistant, you can join a lab by clicking the down arrow next to your username. Then, click User Info. If you select the Lab tab to the left of settings, and under the User tab, you will have the ability to create a lab. You can then press the Join Lab button to join a Lab. You will then be able to provide the Lab ID and the password to join the lab. After pressing 'Submit' you should see a list of Labs you enrolled in, alongside the lab name, institution, PI, and ID.

### Dashboard
Once you have Created/Joined a lab, you will see a list of labs you are enrolled in under the dashboard. If you click the lab, you will be directed to that labs page which will include a list of projects.
